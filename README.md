This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.

I got the idea of making the icon extra large from "Fat Bear Challenge" (https://egitelma.github.io/cmpm-121-demo-1/)

I also really liked how "Dirt To Diamonds" (https://jjoshall.github.io/cmpm-121-demo-1/) made the button grow a bit on clicking, so I decided to add that to this project too.
